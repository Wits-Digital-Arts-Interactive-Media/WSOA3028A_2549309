        <h3>Design</h3>
        <h4>Reference material</h4>
        <p>The main website I used for inspiration was <a href="https://www.rafaelvarona.com/" target="_blank">Rafael Varona's Portfolio</a>.</p>

        <p>I found her home page and the consistent navigation menu on each page a good way to allow users to intuitively explore different sections. A consistent navigation menu is key to a user-friendly experience because it helps visitors orient themselves no matter where they are on the site. It's great for keeping the design unified and makes sure users can always find their way to important sections without unnecessary clicks or confusion. Varona's use of a prominent homepage and a persistent navigation menu likely serves to engage visitors right from the start, providing a snapshot of her skills and offerings while ensuring they can easily search deeper into the content. This setup respects the users' time by streamlining their navigation experience and aligns with web design best practices for accessibility and user experience. Other websites I used as inspiration also used a similar navigation technique.

            <h4>Color Scheme </h4>
            <p>A clean and modern aesthetic, leading to the selection of a neutral color palette with one or two accent colors for emphasis (e.g., a vibrant blue or green).
                Neutral backgrounds (whites and light grays) provide a clean canvas that makes content stand out, enhancing readability and user focus. The choice of a vibrant accent color is to draw attention to key interactive elements like calls to action, links, and buttons. This strategy using color psychology to guide user behavior while maintaining a professional and uncluttered appearance. The neutral backdrop focuses attention on the content, while the color accents guide the user to interactive elements. This approach also aligns with visual accessibility standards.
                 </p>
            <h4>Layout </h4>
            <p>A structured layout with a focus on simplicity and content prioritization, utilizing a combination of grid-based arrangements for sections and flexible containers that ensure responsiveness.
                A structured, grid-based layout allows for a clean organization of content, making it easier for users to navigate and find information quickly. Distinct sections for different content types, such as portfolio pieces, blog entries, and essays, each with its own layout nuance. This structured approach facilitates easy content consumption and allows users to engage with content in a manner that suits their interest, whether they are scanning quickly or diving deep into an essay. The use of flexible containers ensures that the website is accessible and visually appealing across a range of devices, improving the overall user experience by adapting content presentation to suit different screen sizes.
                 </p>
            <h4>Font Choices </h4>
            <p>A combination of a clean, sans-serif font for headings and user interface elements, and a highly readable serif or sans-serif font for body text.
                The choice of a sans-serif font for headings and UI elements is driven by the need for clarity and modernity, ensuring that titles are legible, and interfaces look contemporary. For body text, a serif or easily readable sans-serif font enhances the reading experience, especially for longer texts, by improving legibility and reducing eye strain.
                 </p>
            <h4>Imagery and Visual Storytelling </h4>
            <p>Large, expressive images for portfolio and blog entries, with captions when necessary.
                The images provide a visual break from text and help to tell a story, showcasing my work and thoughts effectively. It also aligns with best practices for portfolio sites where visual work needs to be front and center.
                 </p>
            <h4>Consistency and Navigation</h4>
            <p>Consistent navigation across all pages with a right-aligned menu. This promotes familiarity and ease of use, as users can predictably find the navigation from page to page. The alignment respects the Western reading pattern, from left to right, ending with actionable items.</p>
