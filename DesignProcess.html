                <h4>Reference material</h4>
                <p>The first step in my design process involves brainstorming ideas, researching, and conceptualizing the project.</p>
                
                <p>When looking for references I first looked at a lot of websites for inspiration so I can help design the wireframes for my website but as a continued to design my website, I realized that I needed to design my website to align with my target audience and the purpose of my website. Therefore, I had to revisit references of portfolio website that have similar goals as mine so I can see how they represent their content appropriately.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://ch.maswitzerland.com/" target="_blank">CH Maswitzerland</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.stevewolf.co/shop" target="_blank">Steve Wolf Designs</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.pilgrimcreative.com/" target="_blank">Pilgrim Creative</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.alingwenphotography.com/" target="_blank">Alingwen Photography</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.bilgenursaltik.com/" target="_blank">Bilgenur Saltik</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.rafaelvarona.com/" target="_blank">Rafael Varona</a></li>
            
            </ul>

            <p>The main website I used for inspiration was the one by Rafael.</p>
            <p> I found her home page and the consistent navigation menu on each page a good way to allow users to intuitively explore different sections. A consistent navigation menu is key to a user-friendly experience because it helps visitors orient themselves no matter where they are on the site. It's great for keeping the design unified and makes sure users can always find their way to important sections without unnecessary clicks or confusion. Varona's use of a prominent homepage and a persistent navigation menu likely serves to engage visitors right from the start, providing a snapshot of her skills and offerings while ensuring they can easily search deeper into the content. This setup respects the users' time by streamlining their navigation experience and aligns with web design best practices for accessibility and user experience. Other websites I used as inspiration also used a similar navigation technique. </p>

            <p>After laying down the initial concept, I begin the development phase where I put together wireframes</p>
